napp.alloy.adapter.restapi
==========================

RestAPI Sync Adapter for Titanium Alloy Framework.

### Response Codes

The adapter has been designed with the following structure.

* **200:** The request was successful.
* **201:** The resource was successfully created.
* **204:** The request was successful, but we did not send any content back.
* **304:** The request was not modified.
* **400:** The request failed due to an application error, such as a validation error.
* **401:** An API key was either not sent or invalid.
* **403:** The resource does not belong to the authenticated user and is forbidden.
* **404:** The resource was not found.
* **500:** A server error occurred.

## How To Use

Download [restapi.js](restapi.js) to `PROJECT_FOLDER/app/assets/alloy/sync/` or use NPM thanks to [appc-npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/appc-npm):

```
npm install alloy-sync-restapi --save
```

Add the following to your model in `PROJECT_FOLDER/app/models/`.

	exports.definition = {
		config: {
			"URL": "http://example.com/api/modelname",
			//"debug": 1,
			"adapter": {
				"type": "restapi",
				"collection_name": "MyCollection",
				"idAttribute": "id"
			},
			"headers": { // your custom headers
	            "Accept": "application/vnd.stackmob+json; version=0",
		        "X-StackMob-API-Key": "your-stackmob-key"
	        },
	        "parentNode": "news.domestic" //your root node
		},		
		extendModel: function(Model) {		
			_.extend(Model.prototype, {});
			return Model;
		},
		extendCollection: function(Collection) {		
			_.extend(Collection.prototype, {});
			return Collection;
		}		
	}

Use the `debug` property in the above example to get logs printed with server response to debug your usage of the restapi adapter.

### Lets see this in action

In your Alloy controller, do would use the REST API adapter like this:

```javascript
var collection = Alloy.createCollection("MyCollection"); //or model
//the fetch method is an async call to the remote REST API.
collection.fetch({
	success : function(){
		_.each(collection.models, function(element, index, list){
			// We are looping through the returned models from the remote REST API
			// Implement your custom logic here
		});
	},
	error : function(){
		Ti.API.error("hmm - this is not good!");
	}
});
```

Another example is that,

```javascript
// This is the handle for the item
var model = Alloy.createModel("MyCollection");

var params = {
    field1: "some field",
    fied2: "another field"
};

//the fetch method is an async call to the remote REST API.
model.save(params, {
    success : function(model) {
        Ti.API.log("Yay! Success!");
        Ti.API.log(model);
    },
    error : function(err) {
        Ti.API.error("hmm - this is not good!");
        Ti.API.error(err);
    }
});

```

Under the hood, this API uses the Backbone JS sync functionality. To have a solid understading of this libary, it
will valuable to understand how does BackboneJS manages CRUD operations.



## Special Properties


### Custom Headers

Define your own custom headers. E.g. to add a BaaS API

	"headers": {
		"Accept": "application/vnd.stackmob+json; version=0",
		"X-StackMob-API-Key": "your-stackmob-key"
	}

### Nested Result Objects

Lets say you have a REST API where the result objects are nested. Like the Twitter search API. It has the found tweets in a results object.
Use the `parentNode` to specify from which root object you want to parse children objects.


	config: {
		...
		"parentNode" : "results"
	}

It has support for nested objects.

	config: {
		...
		"parentNode" : "news.domestic"
	}

Since v1.1.1 - you can specify this object as a function instead to custom parse the feed. Here is an example:

*Feed:*
http://www.google.com/calendar/feeds/developer-calendar@google.com/public/full?alt=json&orderby=starttime&max-results=15&singleevents=true&sortorder=ascending&futureevents=true

*Custom parsing:*

```javascript
parentNode: function (data) {
	var entries = [];

	_.each(data.feed.entry, function(_entry) {
		var entry = {};

		entry.id = _entry.id.$t;
		entry.startTime = _entry.gd$when[0].startTime;
		entry.endTime = _entry.gd$when[0].endTime;
		entry.title = _entry.title.$t;
		entry.content = _entry.content.$t;

		entries.push(entry);
	});

	return entries;
}
```

### ETag

This feature will only work if your server supports ETags. If you have no idea what this is, then consult your server admin.
Start be enabling this feature in the model config, like the following:

	config: {
		...
		"eTagEnabled" : true
	}

You do not have to do anything more. The adapter will send and recieve the ETag for every single request and store those locally in the Ti.App.Properties namespace.

The adapter uses the `IF-NONE-MATCH` header to send the newest ETag for the provided url to the server on each request. Once a succesful response is recieved by the adapter, it will store the new ETag automatically.

**Notice: This may be a good idea not to use this while developing, because it will cache and store your ETag - which might end up in wrong situations while you are working**

## Fetch data from POST requests
@Since v1.1.11 you can send requestMethod to fetch data from POST service
```javascript
myModel.fetch({
	requestMethod: 'POST' // GET is default
})
```
